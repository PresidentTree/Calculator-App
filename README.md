# Frontend-Mentor-Calculator-App
My solution to Frontend Mentor's Calculator App challenge. Simple calculations work, but it gets buggy beyond that and I have yet to figured out how to fix it.

## Challenge
Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## Files

- design folder: The folder that contains the visual references to the challenge.
- favion-32x32.png: The favicon for Frontend Mentor that is included with every challenge.
- index.html: The HTML file.
- style.css: The CSS file.
- themes.js: The JS file that controls the theme-switching.
- calculations.js: The JS file that controls the calculations. It is incomplete, but functional.
